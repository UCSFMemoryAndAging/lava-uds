<!--
  This is the context configuration file for the Apache Tomcat application
  server. It contains the resource definition for the database connection
  used by the demo app. This should be modified based on your MySQL database
  configuration. The part of the Resource name "jdbc/demo" can be modified, but
  it must match the portion of the jndiName property in the localDataSource bean 
  in your WEB-INF/context/local/demo/demo-env-tomcat6.xml after the
  "java:comp/env/" portion, e.g. if your Resource name in this file is
  "jdbc/demo" then in the localDataSource bean, the jndiName property should be
  java:comp/env/jdbc/demo

  This assumes that your web application is deployed to the Apache Tomcat
  webapp directory (either as a war file or a war file exploded into a directory
  structure)
  If you want to point the context to deploy your development directory, define
  the docBase attribute of the Context element, where docBase points to your 
  development deployment directory,  e.g.
  <Context docBase="/home/username/project/deploy/demo.war/" reloadable="true">
  
  note: in build.xml the deploy directory is defined as "instance-deploy.path" using
        the "warName" and "deploy.path" defined in your build.properties file as follows:  
        <property name="war.file" value="${warName}.war"/>
        <property name="instance-deploy.path" value="${deploy.path}/${war.file}"/>
