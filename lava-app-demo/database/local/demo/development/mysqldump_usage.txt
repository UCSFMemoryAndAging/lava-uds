Recommended procedure for creating a mysqldump of a database (perhaps to transfer latest production db
to dev for testing, or to get a dump to another developer)

1) Generate the dump file:
1a) Use the following switches:
mysqldump -R -c --comments=FALSE  --tz-utc=FALSE  -u demo -p demo > demodump.sql
--routines == -R
--complete-insert == -c   Use complete INSERT statements that include column names.
--comments=FALSE   Write additional information in the dump file such as program version, server version, and host.
                   This option is enabled by default.
--tz-utc=FALSE    This option enables TIMESTAMP columns to be dumped and reloaded between servers in different time zones.
 
1b) Do NOT run mysqldump as root. No reason to do that.
 
 
2) Modify the dump file to remove the DEFINER everywhere so that the dump can be restored by a different database user.
Edit the dump .sql file and replace all occurences of DEFINER=...  with blank
e.g.
DEFINER=`demo`@`localhost`

3) Create a new database, load the dump file and test the app
