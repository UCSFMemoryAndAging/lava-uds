Recommended procedure for creating a mysqldump of a database (perhaps to transfer latest production db
to dev for testing, or to get a dump to another developer)

1) Use the following switches and generate the dump file:
mysqldump -R -c --comments=FALSE  --tz-utc=FALSE  -u demo -p demo > dumpfile.sql
 
2) Modify the dump file to remove the DEFINER everywhere so that the dump can be restored by a different database user.
Edit the dump .sql file and replace all occurences of DEFINER=...  with blank
e.g.
DEFINER=`demo`@`localhost`

3) Create a new database, load the dump file and test the app
